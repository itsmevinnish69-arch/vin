        <div class="insidebody">
            <p>
                Lending a helping hand, listening to one's suggestions or queries,
                inspiring, leading, and serving others were once my duties as a student leader.
                In my previous school, the Silangit National High School, I were once elected as a 
                member of the Suprem Studemnt Learner Government (SSLG). Being a student leader means
                everyday is a challenge, for a reason that you must always be in check. Time management,
                patience, and perseverance is one of the principle that I acquired as a student leader. 
                Moreover, the most essential weaspon to resolve any challenges that comes in our organization
                is teamwork and not being bias. In this way, I have given the chance to lead, to persevere, to be
                a great citizen, and to be the voice of the unheard.<br><br>
                As I believe that, being a student leader is about making a positive impact, inspiring others, and
                leaving a lasting legacy. It's about listening to others, taking initiative, and empowering your peers
                to do the same. By being a positive influence and role model, you can create change, build community, 
                and make a difference in the lives of those around you.<br><br>
                In a saying, <b>"The First Step to Leadership is Servanthood"</b>, it will embed in our mind that we're not
                only born to show off, we are born to serve in order for us to become a great leader. So don't be afraid
                to take the risks and step out from your comfort zone as it is often where the greatest growth and opportunities lie.<br><br>
                As a student leader before, this is my advocacy, the advocacy that encourages and urges every aspiring youth to embrace
                their potential to become a student leader, the voice of the unheard and the eyes of the unseen. You can be a game-changer
                and make a lasting impact to your school or community. So be it, Lux Mundi lead the way!<br><br>
