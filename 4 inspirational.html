                I took the risk to become a student leader. At first I was hesitant to pursue this field as I know that many people will might judged me, but with great courage and advices I have come up to my weighted decision, I stayed true to myself, and serve my fellow students the best that I can. Through my perseverance and build-up confidence I have managed and commence to the passion of being a leader. Truthfully, I've stayed to being a student leader since Grade 7 - Grade 12 and have recieved an award, the Leadership Award, during our grduation.<br><br>
                I am also once a campus journalist, writing each pieces with integrity, wether it's a feature piece or a short story piece. I've attained compassion, and realized that I wanted to make a difference by telling what is needed to be told, the truth. So I joined a writing competition, specifically the Division Schools Press Conference (DSPC), and luckily I won as a 5th placer, although I did not won the 1st place, I am honored to be part of the top 7 among 30+ students, because I have given a chance to share my passion in writing. This result also lead me to realization that there are things that need to be improved in order to be best version of myself.<br><br>
                Though many challenges came, trying to provoke me, I stayed resilient. And these achivements taught me that growth does not happen when you did nothing, it happens when you step outside to your comfort zone.<br><br>
