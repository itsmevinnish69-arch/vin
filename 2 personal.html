        Being a Lux Mundi is an opportunity I would cherish and acknowledge, guided by the core
        values of Tangub City Global College(TCGC) which were Integrity, Compassion, and Excellence.
        I can act, show, and motivate others to become the Light of the World.</center>

            <h2><center><u><b>Reflection for Faith</b></u></center></h2>

            <p>As a Lux Mundi, faith is a significant aspect of our lives. It's a way of connecting with the Giver of Life,
            embedding by our city's mantra " Una Ang Ginoo", and finding meaning and purpose of life.<br><br>
            Through my studies, I've seen how faith can provide strength and inspiration for people to face life's challenges
            and struggles. It's a way of having hope and trust in a higher power that loves and cares for us.<br><br>
            However, I've also noticed that faith can sometimes lead to differences and conflicts between people, causing disagreements,
            and can even lead to social problems. But, faith is a personal matter that deserves respect and understanding. We should
            respect other's faiths and avoid judging or discriminating against them because of their beliefs.<br><br>Ultimately, faith is
            a vital part of many people's lives, and we should respect and appreciate it. We should have hope and trust in a higher
            power that loves and cares for us, and we should love and respect each other as children of GOD.</p>

            <h2><center><u><b>Reflection for Integrity</b></u></center></h2>

            <p>
                As a Lux Mundi, I've learned that integrity is a vital value that guides our actions and decisions. It's about being honest,
                trustworthy, and morally upright, even when it's challenging or unpopular.<br><br>
                For me, integrity means being true to myself and others. It's about keeping my promises, owning up to my mistakes, and taking
                responsibility for my actions. When I make a mistake, I try to acknowledge it and learn from it, rather than trying to hide or 
                shift the blame.With integrity, we can learn that respect begins with respect. We will be seen as reliable, dependable, and principled.<br><br>
                However, maintaining integrity can be tough as a student, especially when faced with peer pressure or difficult situations. It takes courage
                to stand up for what's right, especially when others are doing something wrong. But, I always remind myself that integrity is a choice, and I
                can choose to do the right thing, even when it's hard.<br><br>

            <h2><center><u><b>Reflection for Responsible Digital Citizenship</b></u></center></h2>
            <p>
                As a Lux Mundi, I've recognized the imortance of being a responsible digital citizen in today's technology-driven world. Being a responsible 
                digital citizen means using technology in a way that is safe, respectful, and responsible.<br><br>
                I've learned that responsible digital citizenship involves several key aspects such as; protecting my online safety and security by using
                strong passwords and being cautious with personal information, being respectful and kind online, thinking critically about the information 
                I share and consume online, respecting other's privacy and intellectual property, and using technology to make a positive impact. As I believe
                that, we can also be digitally the Light of the World.<br>
